## Retrospective

little helper for doing sprint retrospectives

### TODO

* printable view
* add -moz-box-sizing for firefox

### Bugs
* moz input element hangs over on left, moz box sizing rule needs -moz-
* moz/ie up-down arrows don't increment and decrement votes
* ie delete symbol is low on the line, line-height fixes?
* input number element is cutoff, height instead of line-height
